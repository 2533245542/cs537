Linux-Implementation Details:

In the beginning of this program, we declare global variables for the header
and space.

In Mem_Init, the memory is initialzed. Sets the g_head pointer to the beginning
of the initialzed space and reserve the space with mmap.

In Mem_Alloc, use the best fit strategy to allocate memory and then iterates
through the whole list to find the chunk with the smallest memory which
accomodates the requested size. Cuts this section in two and uses the first
half to be used, the other half is marked as free.

In Mem_Free, adds the pointer pointing to free pointer[ptr] at the end of the
head pointer. If there are two successive chunks of free space, coalesces them
and adds them to the end of the head pointer.

In Mem_Dump, iterates though the allocated chunk of memory in head pointer.
Prints the size of each contiguous memory region.

In Mem_Availible, keeps a counter of and adds the size of each availible memory
region and returns the amount of total availible memory
